.SH NAME
__push_compound_metadata \- __push_compound_metadata(biocad.registry, compound, mol)
.SH SYNOPSIS
\fI__push_compound_metadata(biocad.registry, compound, mol)\fR
.SH OPTIONS
.PP
\fBbiocad.registry\fB \fR\- . 
.PP
.PP
\fBcompound\fB \fR\- . A list containing the compound's metadata. Must follow the structure specified in the Details section.
.PP
.PP
\fBmol\fB \fR\- . A molecule record from the current `biocad_registry`. Must contain a character `id` property to associate metadata with this molecule.
.PP
.SH VALUE
.PP
Invisibly returns `NULL`. This function is called for its side effects.
.PP
.SH DETAILS
.PP
The `compound` parameter must be a structured list with the following fields: ```r list( ID = "unique-id",               # Required: Unique identifier (character) formula = "formula-string",     # Required: Chemical formula (character) exact_mass = 0,                 # Required: Exact mass (numeric) name = "name_string",           # Required: Common name (character) IUPACName = "name_string",      # Required: IUPAC name (character) description = "description_string",  # Optional: Description (character) synonym = c("synonyms", "names"),    # Optional: Character vector of synonyms xref = list(                    # Optional: Cross-references to external databases chebi = "",                 # Use "" or omit if unavailable KEGG = "", pubchem = "", HMDB = "", Wikipedia = "", lipidmaps = "", MeSH = "", MetaCyc = "", foodb = "", CAS = "", InChIkey = "",              # Note: InChIkey/InChI/SMILES are stripped from xref InChI = "",                 #   and processed separately SMILES = "" ) ) ``` ### Processing Logic: 1. ​**Structure Handling**: - SMILES strings are parsed (non-strictly) and stored in `sequence_graph` if valid. Invalid SMILES are skipped. - InChIkey, InChI, and SMILES fields are removed from `xref` to avoid duplication; SMILES is explicitly stored in `sequence_graph`. 2. ​**Cross-References**: - Valid `xref` entries (non-empty strings) are added to `db_xrefs`, linked to the molecule's `id`. Each entry is checked for duplicates before insertion. 3. ​**Synonyms**: - Synonyms are stored in the `synonym` table with MD5 hashes to prevent duplicates. Only English (`lang = 'en'`) synonyms are supported.
