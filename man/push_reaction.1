.SH NAME
push_reaction \- push_reaction(biocad.registry, reaction, source.db)
.SH SYNOPSIS
\fIpush_reaction(biocad.registry, reaction, source.db)\fR
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
This function adds or updates a reaction entry in the biocad registry database, including associated enzymes, database cross-references, and metabolite compounds.
.PP
.SH OPTIONS
.PP
\fBbiocad.registry\fB \fR\- . 
.PP
.PP
\fBreaction\fB \fR\- . A list containing the reaction data to be pushed into the database. See "Details" for the required structure.
.PP
.PP
\fBsource.db\fB \fR\- . 
.PP
.SH VALUE
.PP
Invisibly returns `NULL`. The function's primary purpose is to modify the database.

.SH DETAILS
.PP
The `reaction` argument must be a list with the following structure: ```r list( entry = "unique_id",                 # Unique identifier for the reaction (string) definition = "name",                  # Reaction name or equation (string) comment = "description_string",       # Optional description or notes (string) enzyme = list("ec_number1", ...),     # List of EC numbers (strings) for enzymatic regulation db_xrefs = list(                      # List of cross-references to external databases list(name = "dbname", text = "xref_id"), ... ), compounds = list(                     # List of compounds involved in the reaction list( side = "role_string",           # Compound role (e.g., "substrate", "product", "*" for unknown) compound = list(                # Compound details entry = "compound_id", name = "compound_name", formula = "chemical_formula", factor = stoichiometric_factor  # Numeric (default = 1.0 if missing) ) ), ... ) ) ``` - If a reaction with the same `entry` exists, it will be ​**updated**​ with new data. - Enzymes, cross-references, and compounds are linked to the reaction entry. Duplicates are skipped. - Compounds with `side = "*"` are ignored (used for placeholder entries).
