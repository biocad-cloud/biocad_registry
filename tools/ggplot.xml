 ### Create a new ggplot
 
 ``ggplot()`` initializes a ggplot object. It can be used to declare 
 the input data frame for a graphic and to specify the set of 
 plot aesthetics intended to be common throughout all subsequent 
 layers unless specifically overridden.
 </summary>
 <param name="data">
 Default dataset to use for plot. If not already a data.frame, 
 will be converted to one by fortify(). If not specified, must be 
 supplied in each layer added to the plot.
 </param>
 <param name="mapping">
 Default list of aesthetic mappings to use for plot. If not specified, 
 must be supplied in each layer added to the plot.
 </param>
 <param name="args">
 Other arguments passed on to methods. Not currently used.
 </param>
 <param name="environment"></param>
 <returns>
 a ggplot base layer object which can be rendering to graphics by 
 invoke the ``plot`` function.
 </returns>
 <remarks>
 ``ggplot()`` is used to construct the initial plot object, and is 
 almost always followed by + to add component to the plot. There 
 are three common ways to invoke ``ggplot()``:
 
 + ``ggplot(df, aes(x, y, other aesthetics))``
 + ``ggplot(df)``
 + ``ggplot()``
 
 
 The first method Is recommended If all layers use the same data 
 And the same Set Of aesthetics, although this method can also be 
 used To add a layer Using data from another data frame. See the 
 first example below. The second method specifies the Default 
 data frame To use For the plot, but no aesthetics are defined up 
 front. This Is useful When one data frame Is used predominantly 
 As layers are added, but the aesthetics may vary from one layer 
 To another. The third method initializes a skeleton ggplot Object
 which Is fleshed out As layers are added. This method Is useful 
 When multiple data frames are used To produce different layers, 
 As Is often the Case In complex graphics.

 within the layer data, so there is no need to refer to the original 
 dataset (i.e., use ggplot(df, aes(variable)) instead of 
 ``ggplot(df, aes(df$variable)))``. The names for x and y aesthetics 
 are typically omitted because they are so common; all other aesthetics
 must be named.

 ### Scatter Points
 
 The point geom is used to create scatterplots. The scatterplot is most 
 useful for displaying the relationship between two continuous variables. 
 It can be used to compare one continuous and one categorical variable, 
 or two categorical variables, but a variation like geom_jitter(), 
 geom_count(), or geom_bin2d() is usually more appropriate. A bubblechart 
 is a scatterplot with a third variable mapped to the size of points.

 ### Text
 
 Text geoms are useful for labeling plots. They can be used by themselves 
 as scatterplots or in combination with other geoms, for example, for 
 labeling points or for annotating the height of bars. geom_text() adds 
 only text to the plot. geom_label() draws a rectangle behind the text, 
 making it easier to read.

 ## A box and whiskers plot (in the style of Tukey)
 
 The boxplot compactly displays the distribution of a continuous variable. 
 It visualises five summary statistics (the median, two hinges and two 
 whiskers), and all "outlying" points individually.
 </summary>
 <returns></returns>
 <remarks>
 ## Orientation
 This geom treats Each axis differently And, thus, can thus have two 
 orientations. Often the orientation Is easy To deduce from a combination 
 Of the given mappings And the types Of positional scales In use. Thus, 
 ggplot2 will by Default Try To guess which orientation the layer should 
 have. Under rare circumstances, the orientation Is ambiguous And guessing 
 may fail. In that Case the orientation can be specified directly Using the 
 orientation parameter, which can be either "x" Or "y". The value gives 
 the axis that the geom should run along, "x" being the Default orientation 
 you would expect For the geom.

 ## Summary statistics
 The lower And upper hinges correspond To the first And third quartiles 
 (the 25th And 75th percentiles). This differs slightly from the method 
 used by the boxplot() Function, And may be apparent With small samples. 
 See boxplot.stats() For For more information On how hinge positions are 
 calculated For boxplot().

 The upper whisker extends from the hinge To the largest value no further 
 than 1.5 * IQR from the hinge (where IQR Is the inter-quartile range, Or 
 distance between the first And third quartiles). The lower whisker extends 
 from the hinge To the smallest value at most 1.5 * IQR Of the hinge. Data 
 beyond the End Of the whiskers are called "outlying" points And are plotted 
 individually.

 In a notched box plot, the notches extend 1.58 * IQR / sqrt(n). This gives a 
 roughly 95% confidence interval for comparing medians. See McGill et al. 
 (1978) for more details.

 ## Aesthetics
 geom_boxplot() understands the following aesthetics (required aesthetics are 
 in bold):

 + x Or y
 + lower Or xlower
 + upper Or xupper
 + middle Or xmiddle
 + ymin Or xmin
 + ymax Or xmax
 + alpha
 + colour
 + fill
 + group
 + linetype
 + shape
 + size
 + weight

 Learn more about setting these aesthetics In vignette("ggplot2-specs").

 ## Computed variables
 stat_boxplot() provides the following variables, some of which depend on the orientation:

 + width: width of boxplot
 + ymin Or xmin: lower whisker = smallest observation greater than Or equal To lower hinge - 1.5 * IQR
 + lower Or xlower: lower hinge, 25% quantile
 + notchlower: lower edge Of notch = median - 1.58 * IQR / sqrt(n)
 + middle Or xmiddle: median, 50% quantile
 + notchupper: upper edge Of notch = median + 1.58 * IQR / sqrt(n)
 + upper Or xupper: upper hinge, 75% quantile
 + ymax Or xmax: upper whisker = largest observation less than Or equal To upper hinge + 1.5 * IQR

 There are two types of bar charts: geom_bar() and geom_col(). geom_bar()

 If you want the heights of the bars to represent values in the data, use

 ## Modify components of a theme
 
 Themes are a powerful way to customize the non-data components of 
 your plots: i.e. titles, labels, fonts, background, gridlines, and 
 legends. Themes can be used to give plots a consistent customized 
 look. Modify a single plot's theme using theme(); see theme_update() 
 if you want modify the active theme, to affect all subsequent plots. 
 Use the themes available in complete themes if you would like to use 
 a complete theme such as theme_bw(), theme_minimal(), and more. 
 
 Theme elements are documented together according to inheritance, read
 more about theme inheritance below.

 <remarks>
 Theme elements inherit properties from other theme elements hierarchically. 
 For example, axis.title.x.bottom inherits from axis.title.x which inherits 
 from axis.title, which in turn inherits from text. All text elements inherit
 directly or indirectly from text; all lines inherit from line, and all 
 rectangular objects inherit from rect. This means that you can modify the 
 appearance of multiple elements by setting a single high-level component.

 ### Color Blindness
 
 Many color palettes derived from RGB combinations (Like 
 the "rainbow" color palette) are Not suitable To support 
 all viewers, especially those With color vision 
 deficiencies. 
 
 Using viridis type, which Is perceptually uniform In both 
 colour And black-And-white display Is an easy Option To 
 ensure good perceptive properties Of your visulizations. 
 The colorspace package offers functionalities.
 
 to generate color palettes with good perceptive properties,
 
 to analyse a given color palette, Like emulating color 
 blindness,
 
 And to modify a given color palette for better perceptivity.
 
 For more information on color vision deficiencies And 
 suitable color choices see the paper on the colorspace 
 package And references therein.

 The brewer scales provide sequential, diverging and qualitative colour

 discrete values on a map. See https://colorbrewer2.org for more 
 information.
 
 The brewer scales were carefully designed and tested on discrete data. 
 They were not designed to be extended to continuous data, but results 
 often look good. Your mileage may vary.
 
 The following palettes are available for use with these scales:
 
 #### Diverging
 BrBG, PiYG, PRGn, PuOr, RdBu, RdGy, RdYlBu, RdYlGn, Spectral
 
 #### Qualitative
 Accent, Dark2, Paired, Pastel1, Pastel2, Set1, Set2, Set3
 
 #### Sequential
 Blues, BuGn, BuPu, GnBu, Greens, Greys, Oranges, OrRd, PuBu, PuBuGn, PuRd, Purples, RdPu, Reds, YlGn, YlGnBu, YlOrBr, YlOrRd

 <summary>
 A histogram is a type of bar plot that represents the distribution of numerical data. It is an estimate of the 
 probability distribution of a continuous variable and was first introduced by Karl Pearson. Histograms are particularly 
 useful for showcasing the frequency distribution of a dataset, which can provide insights into the underlying
 properties of the data.
 
 Here's how a histogram is constructed and what each of its components represents:
 
 ### Construction of a Histogram:
 1. **Data Grouping:** The data range is divided into a series of intervals, also known as bins. The choice of the number of bins can affect the shape of the histogram, so it's important to choose a number that accurately represents the data.
 2. **Counting Frequencies:** For each bin, the number of data points that fall into the interval is counted. This is the frequency of the bin.
 3. **Plotting:** The frequencies are plotted on the vertical axis, and the bin intervals are plotted on the horizontal axis. Each bar's height corresponds to the frequency of data points within the interval that the bar represents.
 
 ### Components of a Histogram:
 - **BARS:** Each bar represents the frequency of data points within a particular interval. The taller the bar, the more data points fall into that interval.
 - **X-AXIS:** This axis represents the variable being measured and the intervals (bins) into which the data has been divided.
 - **Y-AXIS:** This axis represents the frequency of occurrences for each bin. It can also represent the relative frequency or density if the histogram is normalized.
 - **BIN WIDTH:** The width of the bins is constant and represents the range of values that are counted for each bar.
 
 ### Types of Histograms:
 - **Normal Histogram:** The bars are centered around the mean value, and the distribution may be symmetric if the data is normally distributed.
 - **Cumulative Histogram:** Instead of showing the frequency for each bin, it shows the cumulative frequency up to each bin.
 - **Density Histogram:** In a density histogram, the height of the bar does not represent the frequency but the density of the data within each bin. The total area of all the bars sums to 1.
 
 ### Uses of Histograms:
 - **Data Analysis:** To understand the distribution of the data, such as whether it is symmetric, skewed, bimodal, etc.
 - **Quality Control:** In manufacturing, histograms can help determine if a process is within acceptable limits.
 - **Statistical Analysis:** Histograms can help in choosing appropriate statistical tests or models for data analysis.
 
 ### Limitations:
 - The shape of a histogram can be sensitive to the number of bins chosen.
 - Histograms do not show information about individual data points; they only show the frequency of data within intervals.

 A line chart, also known as a line plot or line graph, is a type of chart used to display the trend, progress, 
 or change over time or between different conditions or categories. It is one of the most common and simple 
 methods for visualizing data sequences. Here's an introduction to the components and purposes of a line chart:
 
 ### Components of a Line Chart:
 
 1. **Horizontal Axis (X-axis):** This axis typically represents the independent variable, often time, which is placed on the horizontal line. Each point on the axis corresponds to a specific point in time or a category.
 2. **Vertical Axis (Y-axis):** This axis represents the dependent variable, which is the data that is being measured or tracked. The scale on the y-axis can be linear or logarithmic, depending on the range and distribution of the data.
 3. **Lines:** These are the curves or straight lines that connect the data points. Each line usually represents a different data series or category.
 4. **Data Points:** These are the individual markers on the chart that indicate the value of the dependent variable at a specific point on the x-axis. They can be represented by dots, squares, or other symbols.
 5. **Legend:** When multiple data series are represented on the same chart, a legend is used to explain what each line represents.
 
 ### Purposes of a Line Chart:
 
 - **Show Trends:** Line charts are ideal for showing trends over time, such as the stock market performance, temperature changes, or website traffic.
 - **Compare Data Series:** They can be used to compare the performance of different groups or categories over the same period.
 - **Highlight Patterns:** Line charts can reveal patterns such as cycles, trends, seasonality, or irregularities in the data.
 - **Forecasting:** By identifying trends, line charts can be used as a tool for making predictions about future data points.
 
 Line charts are versatile and can be used in a wide range of fields, including business, economics, science, and
 education, to present data in a clear and concise manner.

 A scatter plot is a type of data visualization that uses dots to represent the values of two different numerical variables. 
 The position of each dot on the horizontal and vertical axes corresponds to the values of the two variables being plotted. 
 Scatter plots are particularly useful for showing the relationship between two variables and are a key tool in statistics 
 and data analysis.
 
 Here are some key aspects of scatter plots:
 
 ### Purpose:
 - To observe and interpret relationships between two quantitative variables.
 - To identify trends, patterns, or clusters in data.
 - To help in making predictions or drawing conclusions based on the observed relationships.
 
 ### Components:
 - **X-axis (Horizontal axis):** Represents one variable, often called the independent variable.
 - **Y-axis (Vertical axis):** Represents the other variable, often called the dependent variable.
 - **Data Points (Dots):** Each point represents an observation with coordinates corresponding to its values on both axes.
 
 ### Types of Relationships:
 - **Positive Correlation:** As the value of one variable increases, the value of the other variable also increases. The points tend to rise from left to right.
 - **Negative Correlation:** As the value of one variable increases, the value of the other variable decreases. The points tend to fall from left to right.
 - **No Correlation:** There is no apparent relationship between the variables. The points are scattered randomly on the plot.
 - **Non-linear Relationship:** The relationship between variables is not a straight line but might be curved or follow another pattern.
 
 ### Interpreting the Plot:
 - **Cluster:** A group of points that are close together, indicating a concentration of data points.
 - **Outlier:** A point that is distant from other points, indicating an unusual observation or a data error.
 - **Trend Line (or Line of Best Fit):** A line that best represents the relationship between the variables. It can be used to make predictions.
 
 ### Uses:
 - In fields like economics, biology, psychology, and social sciences to understand the dynamics between variables.
 - In machine learning and data science for feature selection and to understand the underlying structure of data.

 A bar plot, also known as a bar chart or bar graph, is a type of data visualization that presents categorical 
 data with rectangular bars with heights or lengths proportional to the values that they represent. Bar plots
 are one of the most common types of charts and are used in a wide variety of fields for their simplicity and
 effectiveness in conveying information.
 
 Here are the main components and characteristics of a bar plot:
 
 **Components:**
 1. **Axes:** The horizontal axis (x-axis) and the vertical axis (y-axis) define the scales for the categories and the values, respectively. 
 2. **Bars:** The bars are the rectangular elements of the plot. Each bar represents a category, and its length or height corresponds to the value of that category.
 3. **Labels:** The categories are usually labeled on the x-axis, and the y-axis is often labeled with the type of value being represented (e.g., frequency, count, percentage).
 4. **Title:** The plot may have a title that describes the data being presented.
 
 **Types of Bar Plots:**
 - **Vertical Bar Plot:** The bars extend vertically, with the categories along the horizontal axis and the values along the vertical axis.
 - **Horizontal Bar Plot:** The bars extend horizontally, with the categories along the vertical axis and the values along the horizontal axis.
 - **Grouped Bar Plot:** Used to compare two or more related groups of data. The bars are grouped by category, and each group contains bars for the different subcategories being compared.
 - **Stacked Bar Plot:** Each bar represents the whole, and segments within the bar represent different parts of the whole. This is useful for showing the composition of each category.
 
 **When to Use Bar Plots:**
 - To compare frequencies, counts, or other quantities across different categories.
 - To display distributions of categorical data.
 - To illustrate changes over time if each bar represents a time period.
 
 **Advantages:**
 - Easy to understand and interpret.
 - Good for comparing different categories.
 - Can be used for a wide range of data types.
 
 **Disadvantages:**
 - Can become cluttered if there are too many categories.
 - May not be the best choice for representing continuous data.

<member name="T:ggplot.layers.ggplotViolin">
 <summary>
 The violin plot is a statistical graph used to visualize the distribution of numerical data, similar to a box plot but with more information. 
 It was introduced byHintze and Nelson in 1998. Here's how it works:
 
 ### Key Components:
 1. **Kernel Density Estimation (KDE)**: The violin plot uses KDE to provide a better understanding of the distribution of data. 
                                         The width of the violin at a given y-value represents the density of data points at that 
                                         value.
 2. **Box Plot Elements**: Inside the violin, there is often a smaller box plot which provides summary statistics:
    - **Median**: A line inside the box that indicates the median value of the data.
    - **Interquartile Range (IQR)**: The box's width represents the IQR, which is the range between the first quartile (25th percentile) and the third quartile (75th percentile).
    - **Whiskers**: Lines extending from the box that represent the range of the data, typically 1.5 * IQR above the third quartile and below the first quartile.
    - **Outliers**: Individual points outside the whiskers, indicating values that are significantly different from the rest of the dataset.
    
 ### How to Interpret:
 - **Shape**: The shape of the violin plot reflects the underlying distribution of the data. A symmetric shape indicates a normal distribution, while an asymmetric shape indicates a skewed distribution.
 - **Size**: The width of the violin at different points is proportional to the number of data points in that region. Wider sections indicate more data points, while narrower sections indicate fewer data points.
 - **Box Plot Inside**: This gives you a quick view of the median, IQR, and potential outliers, which can be compared across violins if multiple violins are plotted side by side.
 
 ### Advantages:
 - Provides more detailed information about the distribution of data than a traditional box plot.
 - Can easily compare distributions between groups by plotting multiple violins side by side.
 
 ### Disadvantages:
 - Can be more complex to understand for those not familiar with statistical distributions.
 - May be less precise in representing the exact distribution of data, especially in the tails, compared to a histogram or density plot.
 
 ### Use Cases:
 - Violin plots are commonly used in fields like data science, biostatistics, and economics to visualize distributions of datasets, 
   especially when comparing multiple datasets or groups.

 Good labels are critical for making your plots accessible to 
 a wider audience. Always ensure the axis and legend labels 
 display the full variable name. Use the plot title and subtitle 
 to explain the main findings. It's common to use the caption 
 to provide information about the data source. tag can be used 
 for adding identification tags to differentiate between multiple 
 plots.

 You can also set axis and legend labels in the individual scales 
 (using the first argument, the name). If you're changing other 
 scale options, this is recommended.
 
 If a plot already has a title, subtitle, caption, etc., And you want 
 To remove it, you can Do so by setting the respective argument To 
 NULL. For example, If plot p has a subtitle, Then p + labs(subtitle = NULL) 
 will remove the subtitle from the plot.
