 <summary>
 This slot specifies the directionality of a reaction. This slot is used in slightly different 
 ways in class Reactions and Enzymatic-Reactions. In class Enzymatic-Reactions, the slot specifies 
 information about the direction of the reaction associated with the enzymatic-reaction, by the 
 associated enzyme. That is, the directionality information refers only to the case in which the 
 reaction is catalyzed by that enzyme, and may be influenced by the regulation of that enzyme.
 
 The slot is particularly important to fill for reactions that are not part of a pathway, because 
 for such reactions, the direction cannot be determined automatically, whereas for reactions 
 within a pathway, the direction can be inferred from the pathway context. This slot aids the 
 user and software in inferring the direction in which the reaction typically occurs in 
 physiological settings, relative to the direction in which the reaction is stored in the database.

 ## Attribute-Value
 
 Each attribute-value file contains data for one class of objects, 
 such as genes or proteins.  A file is divided into entries, where 
 one entry describes one database object.
 An entry consists Of a Set Of attribute-value pairs, which describe 
 properties Of the Object, And relationships Of the Object To other 
 Object. Each attribute-value pair typically resides On a Single 
 line Of the file, although In some cases For values that are Long 
 strings, the value will reside On multiple lines.  An attribute-value 
 pair consists Of an attribute name, followed by the String " - " 
 And a value, For example
 
 ```
 LEFT - NADP
 ```
 
 A value that requires more than one line Is continued by a newline 
 followed by a /. Thus, literal slashes at the beginning Of a line 
 must be escaped As //. A line that contains only // separates objects. 
 Comment lines can be anywhere In the file And must begin With the 
 following symbol
 
 ```
 #
 ```
 
 Starting In version 6.5 Of Pathway Tools, attribute-value files can 
 also contain annotation-value pairs.  Annotations are a mechanism For 
 attaching labeled values To specific attribute values.  For example, 
 we might want To specify a coefficient For a reactant In a chemical 
 reaction. An annotations refers To the attribute value that immediately 
 precedes the annotation.  An annotation-value pair consists Of a caret 
 symbol "^" that points upward To indicate that the annotation annotates 
 the preceding attribute value, followed by the annotation label, 
 followed by the String " - ", followed by a value. The same attribute 
 name Or annotation label With different values can appear any number 
 Of times In an Object.  An example annotation-value pair that refers 
 To the preceding attribute-value pair Is
 
 ```
 LEFT - NADP
 ^COEFFICIENT - 1
 ```
