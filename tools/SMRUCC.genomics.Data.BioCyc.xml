 <summary>
 This slot specifies the directionality of a reaction. This slot is used in slightly different 
 ways in class Reactions and Enzymatic-Reactions. In class Enzymatic-Reactions, the slot specifies 
 information about the direction of the reaction associated with the enzymatic-reaction, by the 
 associated enzyme. That is, the directionality information refers only to the case in which the 
 reaction is catalyzed by that enzyme, and may be influenced by the regulation of that enzyme.
 
 The slot is particularly important to fill for reactions that are not part of a pathway, because 
 for such reactions, the direction cannot be determined automatically, whereas for reactions 
 within a pathway, the direction can be inferred from the pathway context. This slot aids the 
 user and software in inferring the direction in which the reaction typically occurs in 
 physiological settings, relative to the direction in which the reaction is stored in the database.

 When drawing a pathway, the Navigator software usually computes automatically which
 compounds are primaries (mains) and which compounds are secondaries (sides). Occasionally,
 the heuristics used are not sufficient to make the correct distinction, in which
 case you can specify primary compounds explicitly. This slot can contain the list of primary
 reactants, primary products, or both for a particular reaction in the pathway. Each
 value for this slot is of the form (reaction-ID (primary-reactant-ID-1 ... primary-reactant-
 ID-n) (primary-product-ID-1 ... primary-product-ID-n)), where an empty list in either
 the reactant or product position means that that information is not supplied and should
 be computed. An empty list in the product position can also be omitted completely.
 For example, in the purine synthesis pathway, we want to specify that the primary product
 for the final reaction in the pathway should be AMP and not fumarate. The primary
 reactants are still computed. The corresponding slot value would be
 primaries: (ampsyn-rxn () (amp))

 <summary>
 Reactions are organized into two parallel ontologies. Most reaction frames will have one
 or more parents in both ontologies. The first classifies reactions by the nature of their
 substrates, for example, small-molecule reactions are reactions in which all substrates are
 small molecules, whereas protein reactions are reactions in which at least one substrate
 is a protein. The second ontology classifies reactions by conversion type. For example,
 chemical reactions are those in which a chemical transformation takes place, transport
 reactions are those in which a substrate is transported from one compartment to another
 (some reactions may be both transport reactions and chemical reactions if the substrate is
 chemically altered during transport), and binding reactions are those in which substrates
 weakly bind to each other to form a complex.
 Two novel features of our conceptualization with respect to previous metabolic databases
 are to separate reactions from the enzymes that catalyze them, and to use the EC numbers
 defined by the International Union of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology (IUBMB) to
 uniquely identify reactions, not enzymes. (In database terms, the EC number is a key
 for the Reaction class.) The reason for this separation is that the catalyzes relationship
 between reactions and enzymes is many-to-many: a given enzyme might catalyze more
 than one reaction, and the same reaction might be catalyzed by more than one enzyme.
 Frames in the class Enzymatic-Reaction describe the association between an enzyme and
 a reaction. The entire EC taxonomy can be found under the Chemical-Reactions class.
 You should always write transport reactions in the predominate direction in which the
 reaction occurs. Transport reactions are encoded by labeling substrates with their abstract
 (in vs. out) compartment. For example, if a given substrate is transported from the
 periplasm to the cytosol, it would be labeled with “out” as its compartment as a reactant,
 and with “in” as its compartment as a product. Please see the detailed discussion for the
 Rxn-Locations slot. The default compartment is the cytosol, so the cytosol label may be
 omitted for regular reactions. These labels are implemented as annotations in Ocelot.

 These slots hold the compounds from the left and right sides, respectively, of the reaction

 compound (when the compound is not yet described within the DB as a frame). The terms
 reactant and product are not used because these terms may falsely imply the physiological

 The substrates of transport reactions are also described using the Left and Right slots.
 However, the values of these slots are annotated to indicate their compartments. For
 example, a transporter that moves succinate from the periplasm to the cytosol, accompanied

 <summary>
 This slot is used for storing information about the metabolite compartments of a reaction,
 in the case where non-default compartments are involved. The default compartment is
 defined as the frame CCO-CYTOSOL. There are two cases of reactions:
 
    S: Reactions that have all of their metabolites in the same compartment.
 
    T: Reactions that have metabolites in multiple compartments. This can only happen
       at membranes, involving transport reactions or electron transfer reactions (ETRs).
       These reactions may use only the generic directional compartments CCO-IN and
       CCO-OUT for their metabolites, which need to be mapped to the actual compartments
       in a given PGDB for certain operations.
 
 The values of this slot differ between these cases.
 
    S: If this reaction occurs in a non-default compartment, or in several compartments,
       then this slot stores for every compartment the corresponding frame (a child of
       CCO-SPACE). In cases where this slot contains a value, and the reaction also occurs
       in the cytosol, then CCO-CYTOSOL must be included as a slot value.
 
    T: This slot contains one or more frames that are children of CCO-MEMBRANE ,
       or potentially symbols that have to be unique in this slot, for situations where the
       metabolites are in spaces that are not directly adjacent to one membrane, or when 3
       spaces are involved (such as if the transporter spans two membranes). If the reaction
       was not assigned to any particular membrane, then no value is stored, which is the
       default case.
       Additionally, each slot value in this slot will have annotations with the labels 
       CCOIN and CCO-OUT, and in the rare case of 3 compartments involved, also another
       label called CCO-MIDDLE. The values of each of these annotations have to be one valid 
       child of CCO-SPACE. These annotations define the mappings between the COMPARTMENT 
       annotation values, which the metabolites have that are listed in the reaction’s Left 
       and Right slots, and the final compartments in this PGDB.
       Every metabolite in the reaction’s Left and Right slots needs to have a COMPARTMENT
       annotation, the value of which needs to be one of CCO-IN, CCO-OUT, or possibly 
       CCO-MIDDLE in complex situations.
 
 If the reaction is catalyzed by more than one enzyme (i.e. it has more than one 
 enzymaticreaction attached), then each value in the RXN-LOCATIONS slot has to have an 
 annotation called ENZRXNS, which has as its values the frame IDs of the corresponding
 enzymatic-reactions. This allows determining the precise compartment(s) in which the
 catalyzed reaction is occurring.
 Whenever a reaction is transferred between PGDBs (by import or schema upgrade operations),
 all values in the RXN-LOCATIONS are filtered away (i.e. not copied). This
 prevents inapplicable compartments from being introduced into other PGDBs.

 ## Attribute-Value
 
 Each attribute-value file contains data for one class of objects, 
 such as genes or proteins.  A file is divided into entries, where 
 one entry describes one database object.
 An entry consists Of a Set Of attribute-value pairs, which describe 
 properties Of the Object, And relationships Of the Object To other 
 Object. Each attribute-value pair typically resides On a Single 
 line Of the file, although In some cases For values that are Long 
 strings, the value will reside On multiple lines.  An attribute-value 
 pair consists Of an attribute name, followed by the String " - " 
 And a value, For example
 
 ```
 LEFT - NADP
 ```
 
 A value that requires more than one line Is continued by a newline 
 followed by a /. Thus, literal slashes at the beginning Of a line 
 must be escaped As //. A line that contains only // separates objects. 
 Comment lines can be anywhere In the file And must begin With the 
 following symbol
 
 ```
 #
 ```
 
 Starting In version 6.5 Of Pathway Tools, attribute-value files can 
 also contain annotation-value pairs.  Annotations are a mechanism For 
 attaching labeled values To specific attribute values.  For example, 
 we might want To specify a coefficient For a reactant In a chemical 
 reaction. An annotations refers To the attribute value that immediately 
 precedes the annotation.  An annotation-value pair consists Of a caret 
 symbol "^" that points upward To indicate that the annotation annotates 
 the preceding attribute value, followed by the annotation label, 
 followed by the String " - ", followed by a value. The same attribute 
 name Or annotation label With different values can appear any number 
 Of times In an Object.  An example annotation-value pair that refers 
 To the preceding attribute-value pair Is
 
 ```
 LEFT - NADP
 ^COEFFICIENT - 1
